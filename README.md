# PiMote

The Raspberry Pi Web-based universal remote. A small project I worked on my summer break.

To install, read INSTALLING and follow the instructions

# Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, first fork the project, put you edits in it, then make a pull request and I will review it, and most likely accept the change.

# Support

If something goes awry, read all of the open and closed GitHub issues. Hopefully this will at least give you some helpful advice.

If you're still having trouble, post an issue and either me or somebody smart will help you out.

# Contact

If you need to get in contact with me, the best way is by email with jelimoore@gmail.com, but keep in mind that the weekend is the best time to get in touch as I am still in school.

# Major Updates
