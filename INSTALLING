--WHAT YOU NEED--
A Rpi
A 4gb or higher SD card
A breakout for the RPi's GPIOs
An IR Receiver like this one: sparkfun.com/products/10266
An IR LED with resistor, or a high power LED kit like this one: sparkfun.com/products/10732
A working knowlegde of Linux command-line, PHP and HTML.

Firstly, put the IR LED/IR blaster whatnot on GPIO pin 22 of the Pi. Then put the IR receiver on pin 18.

Then flash a new Raspbian image onto an SD card, get SSH or local command access, and get it on the Internet.

After that, run "sudo ./configure.bash"

After the system has rebooted, run the command "sudo service lirc stop".
Next, run "mode2 -d /dev/lirc0". Next, aim any remote at the IR receiver and press a couple buttons. It should wordvomit lots of data.
After that, press control+c to exit mode2.

Then get your remote you want to emulate and run "sudo irrecord -d /dev/lirc0 name_of_remote.conf" replacing name_of_remote with the name of the remote you are emulating, i.e. TV, stereo, etc. If you want a very painless setup, use the keybindings below.
Follow all the prompts, and repeat this step for each remote you want to emulate. Now you will have a few conf's for your remotes.
Now, run "cat your_remote.conf your_second_remote.conf your_third_remote.conf >> lircd.conf", Replacing your_remote, your_second_remote.conf with the actual names of the files you made with irrecord.
Run "sudo rm /etc/lirc/lircd.conf; cp lircd.conf /etc/lirc/lircd.conf; sudo nano /etc/lirc/lircd.conf". Change the "name" to the device it controls; i.e. if you have a panasonic TV, the name would be TV, repeat this for each remote. Press ctrl+x then y, then enter/return.
Now reboot again.

After everything boots up, run "irsend SEND_ONCE (name from lircd.conf) (a key you used in irrecord)". This is case-sensitive. Your device should respond, if not, either you didn't follow the steps coorectly or your IR LED isn't wired up correctly.
If it does happen to work, you're done-ish. If you need more remotes, duplicate an existing file and make necesary modifications. Else, you're good for testing and permanent installation. Just make sure the IR LED can reach the devices.
