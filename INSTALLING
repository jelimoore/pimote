--WHAT YOU NEED--
A Rpi
A 4gb or higher SD card
A breakout for the RPi's GPIOs
An IR Receiver like this one: sparkfun.com/products/10266
An IR LED with resistor, or a high power LED kit like this one: sparkfun.com/products/10732
A working knowlegde of Linux command-line, PHP and HTML.
Firstly, flash a new Raspbian image onto an SD card and get SSH or local command access, and bring up Ethernet or WiFi

After that, you can either 

a: install with ./install and follow 1.2, or
b: follow 1.1 below

1.1 -- MANUAL INSTALLATION -- Skip if using ./install
1.1.1: Run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y. This updates the tool and upgrades the packages
1.1.2: Run sudo apt-get install lirc -y. This installs LIRC, which is used to capture and emulate the remotes' button codes
Edit /etc/modules and add the following lines:
lirc_dev
lirc_rpi gpio_in_pin=18 gpio_out_pin=22

Add this line to /boot/config.txt
dtoverlay=lirc-rpi,gpio_in_pin=18,gpio_out_pin=22

Reboot.
1.1.3: When the system comes up, run sudo apt-get install lighttpd -y. This installs the HTTPD server.
1.1.4: Next, run sudo apt-get install php5-common php5-cgi php5 -y. This installs PHP5 required for the webapp.

1.2 -- CONFIGURING
1.2.1: Assuming you have the IR Receiver wired up, run sudo service lirc stop. This stops the LIRC service so we can se the IR Receiver in the user-space.
Next, run mode2 -d /dev/lirc0. Press buttons on a remote and lots of text should show up. If it doesn't, make sure your receiver is wired up properly.
After that, run irrecord -d /dev/lirc0 ~/(name of remote).conf. Follow the instructions.
Run that for each remote you plan to use, changing the name of the .conf file.
Remove the /etc/lirc/lircd.conf file. Create a new one, and paste in the contents of each file. Change the name of each remote in the "begin remote" section to a one-word name for the remote.
Restart LIRC with sudo service lirc restart.
1.2.2: Use the templates to create a webremote for each device. Follow the instructions for each.
