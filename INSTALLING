--WHAT YOU NEED--
A Rpi
A 4gb or higher SD card
A breakout for the RPi's GPIOs
An IR Receiver like this one: sparkfun.com/products/10266
An IR LED with resistor, or a high power LED kit like this one: sparkfun.com/products/10732
A working knowlegde of Linux command-line, PHP and HTML.
Firstly, flash a new Raspbian image onto an SD card and get SSH or local command access, and bring up Ethernet or WiFi

After that, you can run ./startup.bash as root with sudo ./startup.bash

After the system has rebooted, run the command "sudo service lirc stop".
Next, run "mode2 -d /dev/lirc0". Next, aim any remote at the IR receiver and press a couple buttons. LOTS of text should fly by.
After that, press control+c to exit mode2.
Get your remote you want to emulate and run "sudo irrecord -d /dev/lirc0 name_of_remote.conf" replacing name_of_remote with the name of the remote you are emulating.
Follow all the prompts, and repeat this step for each remote you want to emulate. Now you will have a few .conf's for your remotes.
Now, run "cat your_remote.conf your_second_remote.conf your_third_remote.conf >> lircd.conf". Replace your_remote, your_second_remote.conf with the actual names of the files you made with irrecord.
Run "sudo rm /etc/lirc/lircd.conf; cp lircd.conf /etc/lirc/lircd.conf; sudo nano /etc/lirc/lircd.conf". Change the "name" to the device it controls; i.e. if you have a panasonic flat panel TV, the name would be TV, repeat this for each remote. Press control+x then y, then enter/return.
Now reboot again.

After everything boots up, run "irsend SEND_ONCE (device) (a key you used in irrecord)". This is case-sensitive. Your device should respond, if not, either you didn't follow the steps coorectly or your IR LED isn't wired up coorectly.
If it does happen to work, continue onto the next step.

Now run "./template CREATE TV". This will give you a TV controller web template. You can use templates for DVD STEREO and SETTOP
If you want a challenge, use the MACRO option. This is a scripting-type thing for action, i.e. "Watch TV" will power on the TV, stereo, set-top box, turn the set-top to your favorite channel, and set the TV to accept input from whatever input the set-top box is on.
Edit the templates to use your own button names and what command they correspont to.
That's it! All you have to do is navagate to your your.i.p.here/tv.php for the TV, stereo.php for the stereo, etc.
